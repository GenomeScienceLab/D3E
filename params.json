{"name":"D3E","tagline":"Discrete Distributional Differential Expression","body":"#D<sup>3</sup>E: Discrete Distributional Differential Expression\r\n\r\n##About\r\nD<sup>3</sup>E is a tool for identifying differentially-expressed genes, based on single-cell RNA-seq data. D<sup>3</sup>E consists of two modules: one for identifying differentially expressed (DE) genes, and one for fitting the parameters of a Poisson-Beta distribution. A web-version which can be used for small samples can be accessed at http://www.sanger.ac.uk/sanger/GeneRegulation_D3E/\r\n\r\n##Files\r\n- **D3EUtil.py** : a collection of methods for running the D<sup>3</sup>E analysis\r\n- **D3ECmd.py** : an actual D<sup>3</sup>E tool (requires **D3EUtil.py** for execution)\r\n- **D3EWed.py** : a light version of D<sup>3</sup>E, for running as a web-service (requires **D3EUtil.py** for execution)\r\n- **D3EMakeControl** : a script for making a control file for the analysis\r\n- **D3EAnalyse** : a script for filtering DE genes based on the result of control file analysis\r\n\r\n##Getting Started\r\n\r\nPlease visit our Wiki pages for <a href=\"https://github.com/hemberg-lab/D3E/wiki/User-Guide\" target=\"_blank\">User Guide</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/hemberg-lab/D3E/wiki/Example\" target=\"_blank\">Example</a>.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
