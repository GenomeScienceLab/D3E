Discrete Distributional Differential Expression (D<sup>3</sup>E) is a tool for identifying differentially-expressed genes, based on single-cell RNA-seq data. The main assumption we use in our method is that expression of RNA follows Poisson-beta distribution with three parameters &alpha;, &beta; and &gamma;. The first two correspond to the rate of gene activation and deactivation, and the latter corresponds to the rate of transcription when a gene is in an active state.
